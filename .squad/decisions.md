## 2026-05-17: 2026 Tuya Portal-Free Key Extraction Assessment (Cypher — CORRECTION)

**Date:** 2026-05-17T10:10:26-07:00  
**Author:** Cypher (Integration / Protocol Engineer)  
**Status:** Definitive  
**⚠️ SUPERSEDES:** Prior claim in this same decisions.md (session cypher-6, Touchstone Tuya Feasibility) that `make-all/tuya-local` cloud-auth "passes Mads' no developer app boundary" if he has HA. That was **optimistic and under-flagged three critical constraints.**

### Verdict

**Yes-but-fragile.** One genuinely portal-free path exists in 2026. However, it is **not broadly applicable** and carries **unilateral revocation risk** by Tuya.

### What Was Wrong in Cypher-6

The prior entry stated:
> "Path 2 detail — make-all/tuya-local (HA integration, no dev account needed) ... uses SmartLife credentials only, no developer portal. Recommended if user has HA."

**Constraints that were glossed over:**

1. **Requires Home Assistant to be installed and running** — not a standalone CLI tool. This was mentioned but buried as "~5 min if you have HA"; it's a prerequisite, not just a timing note.

2. **Relies on hardcoded Tuya-issued `client_id = "HA_3y9q4ak7g4ephrvke"`** (`schema = "haauthorize"`) — Tuya can revoke this ID unilaterally, breaking the entire flow for all `tuya-local` users simultaneously. No workaround. This fragility was **completely unmentioned**.

3. **Auth endpoint is `apigw.iotbing.com`, not iot.tuya.com** — This is why it's "portal-free," but this distinction was not explained. The endpoint is Tuya's consumer Smart Life API gateway. It is **not** the Tuya IoT developer portal (`iot.tuya.com`). However, Tuya controls this endpoint and can modify or revoke it.

### The Correct Assessment

| Method | Portal Required | HA Dependency | Revocation Risk | Recommended |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `make-all/tuya-local` cloud-auth | ❌ No | ⚠️ Yes, required | 🔴 High (hardcoded client_id) | ✅ Only if HA installed; acknowledge risk |
| `tinytuya wizard` | ⚠️ Yes (free account) | ❌ No | 🟡 Low (Tuya can time-limit trial) | ✅ Most durable non-HA path |
| `localtuya` (HA) | ⚠️ Yes (required) | ⚠️ Yes | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ Fallback |

### For Mads Specifically

**Mads does not run Home Assistant.** Therefore:
- The portal-free path is **inaccessible** to him.
- The **iot.tuya.com portal path he has already started is the correct choice** — it is more durable than relying on a Tuya-controlled consumer API and a hardcoded client_id.

## 2026-05-17: Bosch → Touchstone Pivot (User Directive)

**Date:** 2026-05-17T09:53:47-07:00  
**By:** Mads Kristensen (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Archived (Bosch), Active (Touchstone)

Drop the Bosch Home Connect fridge driver project. Do not pursue it further. New target: Hubitat driver for the Touchstone LED fireplace (WiFi-connected; Tuya-based; exposes flame color, log color, brightness, etc.).

**Rationale:** Developer-portal requirement was a non-starter for Bosch. Pivoting to Tuya-based device with more promising integration surface.

**Impact:** Bosch decision record remains for historical reference but is no longer active scope. Next phase: Feasibility pass for Touchstone by Cypher + Trinity.

## 2026-05-17: Touchstone Tuya Feasibility (Cypher)

**Date:** 2026-05-17T09:53:47-07:00  
**Author:** Cypher (Integration / Protocol Engineer)  
**Status:** Complete — ready for team review

### Verdict

**Yes-with-caveats.** Tuya Local (LAN) over `interfaces.rawSocket` + AES is the right path. The Touchstone Sideline is confirmed Tuya (product ID `qhwld7e4eqvu5fbp`) with a fully documented DP map from production HA integration. Local key extraction is one-time only and requires no developer portal if using SmartLife credentials via HA tuya-local cloud-auth path.

### Key Findings

**Control path:** Tuya Local (LAN) — unconditionally preferred over Tuya Cloud API.

**Device confirmed:** Touchstone Sideline is explicitly listed in `make-all/tuya-local` DEVICES.md. Product ID `qhwld7e4eqvu5fbp` is the Tuya catalog identifier.

**DP map — Touchstone Sideline** (from `make-all/tuya-local` reference implementation):

| DP | Type | Name | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | boolean | Power | `true` = on, `false` = off |
| 101 | string | Flame color/effect | `"1"`=Orange, `"2"`=Blue, `"3"`=Yellow, `"4"`=Orange+Blue, `"5"`=Orange+Yellow, `"6"`=Blue+Yellow |
| 102 | string | Flame brightness | `"1"`=20%, `"2"`=40%, `"3"`=60%, `"4"`=80%, `"5"`=100% |
| 103 | string | Flame speed | `"1"`=Slow, `"2"`=Medium, `"3"`=Fast |
| 104 | string | Ember/log color | `"1"`=orange, `"2"`=red, `"3"`=blue, `"4"`=yellow, `"5"`=green, `"6"`=purple, `"7"`=teal, `"8"`=pink, `"9"`=white, `"10"`=peachpuff, `"11"`=black (off), `"12"`=grey (Mystery/Cycle effects) |
| 105 | string | Log brightness | `"1"`–`"12"` = 8%–100% (linear scale) |

**Platform feasibility:** Hubitat `interfaces.rawSocket` supports Tuya Local v3.3 protocol (AES-128-ECB) with available `javax.crypto.Cipher`. Known issue: silent drop on idle connections — mitigated by heartbeat ping every 20 seconds + reconnect handler. Standard practice for Tuya drivers.

**Local key extraction UX:** Three paths compared:
- `make-all/tuya-local` cloud-auth: ✅ Recommended. No developer account required — uses SmartLife app credentials only (~5 min).
- `tinytuya wizard`: ⚠️ Fallback. Requires free Tuya IoT developer account (~20 min one-time).
- mITM: ❌ Broken since 2023.

**Key correction:** Flame and ember colors are **NAMED PALETTE INDICES** (6 flame effects, 12 log colors), **not** free-form RGB. `ColorControl` capability expecting HSV input will map user colors to nearest palette entry with confusing rounding. **Use named custom commands (`setFlameColor(name)`, `setLogColor(name)`) instead** — more honest UX.

### Open Questions for Switch (Real-Device Validation)

1. **Model confirmation** — Is it the Sideline series? Check the device label. Run `python -m tinytuya scan` to verify.
2. **Protocol version** — Run `python -m tinytuya scan` to confirm v3.3 vs v3.4/v3.5. Determines framing complexity.
3. **Full DP map** — Run `python -m tinytuya wizard` or use HA tuya-local cloud-auth. Confirms DP assignments match assumptions.
4. **Connectivity test** — After extracting `deviceId`, `ip`, `localKey`, run `tinytuya` test to confirm local control works.
5. **Single vs dual connection** — Tuya modules often allow one TCP connection at a time. Test by closing all apps before connecting.

## 2026-05-17: Touchstone Architecture (Trinity)

**Date:** 2026-05-17T09:53:47-07:00  
**Author:** Trinity (Lead / Architect)  
**Status:** Proposal — awaiting Mads approval

### Recommended Architecture

**Single Groovy driver, no cloud dependency.** Tuya Local (LAN) over rawSocket TCP + AES. Single file at `drivers/touchstone-fireplace/touchstone-fireplace.groovy`.

### Capability Mapping

| Capability / Attribute | DP | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `Switch` | 1 | on/off |
| `SwitchLevel` | 102 | Flame brightness; map 0–100 → `"1"`–`"5"` buckets |
| `Refresh` | all | Status query |
| `Initialize` | — | Socket connect + schedule |
| **Custom command `setFlameColor(name)`** | 101 | Named palette: orange, blue, yellow, orange+blue, orange+yellow, blue+yellow |
| **Custom command `setLogColor(name)`** | 104 | Named palette (12 colors) |
| **Custom command `setLogBrightness(level)`** | 105 | 12-step brightness for log lighting |
| **Custom command `setFlameSpeed(speed)`** | 103 | Slow / Medium / Fast |
| **Custom attribute `flameColor`** | string | Current flame effect name |
| **Custom attribute `logColor`** | string | Current log/ember color name |

**⚠️ CORRECTION (Cypher finding supersedes Trinity's original proposal):**  
Trinity originally recommended `ColorControl` capability for flame color mapping. **This is incorrect and should NOT be used.** Cypher's analysis confirms that flame and ember colors are named palette indices (6 flame effects, 12 log colors), not free-form RGB/HSV. `ColorControl` with HSV input will produce confusing rounding behavior when mapping to palette entries. **Use the named custom commands above instead** — this is the correct UX for palette-based color selection.

### Effort Estimate

**Medium — 2–3 sessions.**

- Session 1: Cypher confirms DP map from tinytuya output; Trinity finalizes DP-to-capability mapping; Tank scaffolds driver with Tuya Local protocol layer.
- Session 2: Tank wires all capability commands to DPs; Switch writes test plan; Mads validates on real device.
- Session 3 (conditional): If protocol version is 3.4/3.5 or DPs differ, one additional session for fixes.

### Folder Layout

```
drivers/
  touchstone-fireplace/
    touchstone-fireplace.groovy     ← single driver file
    README.md                       ← install guide + local-key extraction steps
    packageManifest.json            ← HPM manifest (new UUID v4)
```

### Next Steps

1. **Mads:** If feasibility confirmed safe, run `tinytuya wizard` (or `python -m tinytuya scan`) against the fireplace and share output JSON.
2. **Cypher:** Analyze DP map output, confirm protocol version (3.3/3.4/3.5).
3. **Tank:** Once DP map is known, scaffold driver using Tuya Local protocol layer.
4. **Link:** README + local-key extraction steps once architecture is locked.

### Heater DP Map (Official Tuya Schema)

| DP | Type | Name | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | bool | switch | on/off |
| 2 | int | temp_set | 19–30°C |
| 3 | int | temp_current | 0–50°C |

### Vendor-Custom LED DPs (Empirical Mapping — TBD)

Not in Tuya schema. Observed values from live DP dump:

| DP | Type | Observed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 101 | string-enum | "1" | TBD |
| 102 | string-enum | "5" | TBD |
| 103 | string-enum | "1" | TBD |
| 104 | string-enum | "4" | TBD |
| 105 | string-enum | "5" | TBD |
| 107 | bool | false | TBD |
| 108 | bool | false | TBD |

Next session: Validate empirical DP mapping via Tuya app interaction.

### Operational Lesson

**Tuya IoT Cloud Project API subscription gotcha:** A new Tuya IoT Cloud Project does NOT auto-subscribe to the APIs needed for `tinytuya wizard`. Must manually subscribe to:
- IoT Core
- Authorization Token Management
- Smart Home Basic Service
- Device Status Notification

All are free trials with no card on file required. This was the key blocker before Mads could run the wizard.
